### [About Us](https://github.com/uacaps/Blog/tree/master/Posts/2013_08_13)

The Center for Advanced Public Safety (CAPS) is a unit within the University of Alabama that specializes in advanced software development to assist traffic safety, law enforcement and homeland security.

We also do the occasional open source project in our spare time or when we find something work giving back to the taxpayers. You can find our tech blog [here](https://github.com/uacaps/CAPSBlog). This is where you can find a great rundown of our projects and thoughts, big or small.
